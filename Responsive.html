/*
Responsive design is achieved building crushed columns using float:left min-width and width
Fluid design is achived by having elastic content using calc() and % sizes only except for images
It is often a good thing to mix both to achieve more natural results
While doing the design of the web page for responsive design try taking a moment to see how you will place your content
do not put something related to each other in an other column.

If you are making an interface with no columns that adapts to resolution it is not responsive it is fluid.
Bootstrap does both
